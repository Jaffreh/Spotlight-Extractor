# Windows Spotlight Extractor
_Extract the Windows Spotlight images directly from your file system_

Spotlight images are the always-changing background pictures at login for all Windows machines. These images get constantly updated by Windows onto your machine when it connects to any of their servers. Once updated, the spotlight images that were shown before will not show anymore, only the new ones. This became frustrating everytime I came across a background wallpaper I liked and never see again. So, I created this application to solve that problem. With this desktop application, you can simply click on it, executing it, and you'll see a folder on your Desktop containing all the images within your device's Spotlight images.  

The main problem this application solves in one click is travelling deep into your file system, with user authority, finding the files, and transforming them to a .jpg format, while keeping the original ones intact, and moving all the new .jpg files onto a new folder on the user's desktop

I've included an installer.exe file that you can download and run to properly install the program onto your Windows computer. Once installed, you can double click on the 'Spotlight Extractor' app and, within seconds, you will find a 'LockScreenImgs' folder on your Desktop containing all the images from Spotlight.

Compiled with GCC version 11.2.0
Will run on Windows Vista and up.

Enjoy!
